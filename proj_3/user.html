        <h3>iOS/Android</h3>
        <h3>Overview:</h3>

        <p>Press "New project" and choose your desired resolution and framerate. The project will open.</p>

        <p>In a new project, the timeline will be only one frame long to begin with. You will see a Background layer (this cannot be deleted) and a default "Layer 1" with one drawing, and above that the green playhead indicating the current frame. To the left are sliders to control the opacity of each layer, and buttons to change the layer order or delete a layer.</p>

        <p>To extend the duration a drawing is seen when played back, drag the "Drawing duration" slider in the timeline panel; or drag the arrow on the right side of the currently selected drawing on the timeline.</p>

        <p>Each drawing is represented by a blue button on the timeline. Press on any one to go to that drawing; or, drag the green playhead along the top bar of the timeline to scrub through the drawings; or, use the forward/back buttons <img alt="Previous" src="images/user/ic_previous.png" width="15px"><img alt="Next" src="images/user/ic_next.png" width="15px"> step back and forth; or, drag up/down from the <img alt="Frame Flip" src="images/user/ic_frameflip.png" width="6px"> button for quick flipping. By default, going forward from the end of the timeline will automatically add a new drawing and extend the timeline to fit it. You can also add drawings to the timeline manually by clicking "Add drawing" in the Tools panel.</p>

        <p>You can press and hold on a drawing in the timeline to drag/drop it earlier or later, or to add a new drawing.</p>

        <p>Draw in drawing canvas. Pinch to zoom/pan. For drawing you have available a Brush tool <img alt="Brush" src="images/user/ic_brush.png" class="ic">, an Eraser tool <img alt="Eraser" src="images/user/ic_eraser.png" class="ic">, a Fill tool <img alt="Bucket" src="images/user/ic_bucket.png" class="ic">, and a Lasso selection tool <img alt="Lasso" src="images/user/ic_lasso.png" class="ic">.</p>

        <p>The Onion Skin feature lets you see previous and following drawings overlayed on the current frame. Toggle it on and off with the Onion skin button in the Tools panel, and adjust the range of drawings visible in the Tool Options panel.</p>

        <p>Press the Play button in the Tools panel to play back a preview of your animation. In the <img alt="Hamburger Menu" src="images/user/ic_hamburger.png" class="ic"> menu you can export a Quicktime video, a PNG image sequence, or an animated GIF.</p>
        
        <h2><img alt="Panels" src="images/user/panels.png" class="image fifty" style="border: none;"></h2>

        <ul>
          <li><img alt="Fullscreen" src="images/user/ic_fullscreen.png" class="ic"> - Press to hide all button panels and expand drawing canvas to fullscreen.</li>
          <li><strong>Drawing duration</strong> - How many frames the current drawing will remain on screen when played back.</li>
            <ul>
              <li><img alt="Independent" src="images/user/independent.gif" width="45px" style="border: none;"><strong>Independent</strong> - Duration slider affects only current layer.</li>
              <li><img alt="Sync layers" src="images/user/sync_layers.gif" width="45px" style="border: none;"><strong>Sync layers</strong> - Duration slider affects all layers together. Deleting a drawing will expand the previous drawing's duration to keep overall timing the same.</li>
              <li><img alt="Maintain overall duration" src="images/user/maintain_overall_duration.gif" width="45px" style="border: none;"><strong>Maintain overall duration</strong> - The next drawing's duration will get shorter as the current drawing's duration gets longer and vice versa, to keep overall timing the same. Deleting a drawing will expand the next drawing's duration to keep overall timing the same.</li>
            </ul>
          <li><strong>Drawing label</strong> - Give the current drawing a label, which will be displayed on its button in the timeline. (Useful for organization.)</li>
          <li><strong>Delete drawing</strong> - Deletes the current drawing.</li>
          <li><strong>Make cycle</strong> - Converts the current drawing into a loop of the previous X number of drawings on the timeline that you choose. Any changes to those drawings will be reflected automatically in the repeated cycle of them. The cycle will appear green on the timeline, or red if it cannot work (either you are trying to cycle more drawings than exist, or you are trying to cycle a cycle).</li>
          <li><img alt="Move Back" src="images/user/ic_moveback.png" width="30px"> - Swaps the current drawing with the previous drawing on the timeline.</li>
          <li><img alt="Move Forward" src="images/user/ic_moveforward.png" width="30px"> - Swaps the current drawing with the next drawing on the timeline.</li>
          <li><strong>Edit multiple</strong> - Select multiple drawings in a range of frames on the timeline and edit them all at once.</li>
          <li><strong>Playback range</strong> - Adjust these sliders to play only part of the animation when previewing. You can also choose when exporting to export only the playback range.</li>
          <li><img alt="Hamburger Menu" src="images/user/ic_hamburger.png" class="ic"> - Opens a popup menu of actions that affect the whole project.</li>

A visual representation of the audio waveform will display on the timeline.</li>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Remove audio</strong> - Will appear in the menu if you have already imported an audio file. Pressing it will remove that audio file from your project.</li>
                </ul>
              <li><strong>Import image(s)</strong> - Choose an image file to paste into the current drawing. Will be scaled to fit the project's resolution. If you select multiple images, they will be imported as a sequence on a new layer.</li>
              <li><strong>Import video</strong> - Choose a video file to import to your project as a new layer. Will be scaled to fit the project's resolution.</li>
              <li><strong>Export video</strong> - Export Quicktime video, GIF, or PNG image sequence. PNG supports transparent background, the other formats do not.</li>

          <p>Create a new project from the File menu and choose your desired resolution and framerate. A drawing canvas window will open. In a new project, the timeline will be only one frame long to begin with. You will see a Background layer (this cannot be deleted) and a default "Layer 1" with one drawing, and above that the playhead indicating the current frame. To the left are sliders to control the opacity of each layer, and buttons to change the layer order or delete a layer.</p>
          <p>To extend the duration a drawing is seen when played back, drag the "Drawing duration" slider; or drag the edge between drawings on the timeline; or press F5 or the + key to increase duration and Shift F5 or the - key to decrease.</p>

          <p>You can press and hold on a drawing in the timeline to drag/drop it earlier or later, or to add a new drawing.</p>
          <p>For drawing you have available a Brush tool (B), an Eraser tool (E), a Fill tool (F), and a Lasso selection tool (L), as well as a Zoom tool (Z) to zoom in by clicking on the canvas (or out when holding the Option key), and a Pan tool (H) to move the canvas around the window (the Pan tool can also be activated temporarily by holding down the Spacebar).</p>
          <p>The Onion Skin feature lets you see previous and following drawings overlayed on the current frame. Toggle it on and off with the Onion skin button in the Tools panel (or the O key), and adjust the range of drawings visible in the Tool Options panel.</p>
          <p>Press the Play button in the Tools panel (or the Enter key) to play back a preview of your animation. In the File menu you can export a Quicktime video, a PNG image sequence, or an animated GIF.</p>

        <p>Create a new project from the File menu or by pressing the "New project" button, and choose your desired resolution and framerate. A drawing canvas window will open. In a new project, the timeline will be only one frame long to begin with. You will see a Background layer (this cannot be deleted) and a default "Layer 1" with one drawing, and above that the playhead indicating the current frame. To the left are sliders to control the opacity of each layer, and buttons to change the layer order or delete a layer.</p>
        <p>To extend the duration a drawing is seen when played back, drag the "Drawing duration" slider; or drag the edge between drawings on the timeline; or press F5 or the + key to increase duration and Shift F5 or the - key to decrease.</p>
        <p>Each drawing is represented by a blue button on the timeline. Click on any one to go to that drawing; or, drag along the top bar of the timeline to scrub through the drawings; or, use the arrow keys to step back and forth; or, drag up/down from the  button in the Tools panel for quick flipping. By default, going forward from the end of the timeline will automatically add a new drawing and extend the timeline to fit it. You can also add drawings to the timeline manually by clicking "Add drawing" in the tool panel, or with the following keyboard shortcuts:</p>

        <p>You can press and hold on a drawing in the timeline to drag/drop it earlier or later, or to add a new drawing.</p>
        <p>For drawing you have available a Brush tool (B), an Eraser tool (E), a Fill tool (F), and a Lasso selection tool (L), as well as a Zoom tool (Z) to zoom in by clicking on the canvas (or out when holding the Option key), and a Pan tool (H) to move the canvas around the window (the Pan tool can also be activated temporarily by holding down the Spacebar). If you're using a tablet with a touch screen, you can use two fingers to pan/zoom.</p>
        <p>The Onion Skin feature lets you see previous and following drawings overlayed on the current frame. Toggle it on and off with the Onion skin button in the Tools panel (or the O key), and adjust the range of drawings visible in the Tool Options panel.</p>
        <p>Press the Play button in the Tools panel (or the Enter key) to play back a preview of your animation. In the File menu you can export an MP4 video, a PNG image sequence, or an animated GIF.</p>
