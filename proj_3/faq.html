    <h1>FAQ</h1>

      <h3>What's the advantage of RoughAnimator over other animation software?</h3>
      <p>Portability and price! RoughAnimator is the most powerful hand drawn animation program in this price range, and the only one specifically designed to be easy to use on a tablet without sacrificing professional-level features. 
        As a professional animator myself I'm familiar with all the usual complaints about animation software, so I've tried to design the app with those things in mind and make it as intuitive/functional as possible for the needs of animators. 
        Take your work on the road with you - make an independent film while you commute - or just practice your animating skills!</p>
      
      <h3>What does RoughAnimator NOT do?</h3>
      <p>RoughAnimator is NOT meant to be a design/illustration program. You won't find shape tools or fancy simulated paintbrushes in it, just simple freehand drawing/coloring.</p>
      
      <p>RoughAnimator is NOT a vector program. Everything is bitmap images, made out of pixels, so resolution is limited, and scaling/rotating will result in a loss of quality.</p>
      
      <p>RoughAnimator will NOT do your animation for you. There's no keyframing/tweening, you have to draw every frame yourself.</p>
      
      <p>RoughAnimator is NOT a full compositing/video editing/audio editing suite. You can't make a whole movie just in this app. It's a specialized tool for one part of the process, and there are other better tools for the other parts.</p>
      
      <h3>Can I use it on a phone?</h3>
      <p>Yes, but the interface could seem cramped and obviously you'll have less space to draw than on a tablet. Your mileage may vary. 
        A large phone with a stylus such as the Samsung Galaxy Note is your best bet. 
        There are settings in the app preferences to hide some of the lesser used buttons, and to adjust the scale of the interface overall, which might help to make it more usable.</p>
      
      <h3>Are the iOS/Android versions and the Mac/Windows versions the same?</h3>
      <p>Mostly. Files can be transferred between them, no problem. The interface is slightly different to take advantage of the different operating systems and having a mouse/keyboard vs. a touch screen. 
        Mac/Windows may be able to handle bigger files better since desktop computers tend to be more powerful. 
        However, more of my development attention is focused on the iOS/Android versions (due to higher demand), so those tend to be more polished - it takes me longer to get the newest improvements ported to the Mac/Windows versions.</p>
      
      <h3>Can you increase the resolution limit?</h3>
      <p>You can override the limit by holding down the Okay button. However I haven't optimized it for higher resolutions. The bigger the images, the slower and less stable the app will be, so be careful with it. It may or may not work okay depending on your device.</p>
      
      <h3>Can you add this feature I want?</h3>
      <p>Maybe, <a href="contact.html">contact me</a>. Don't hold your breath, programming is hard and this isn't my day job - but I'll see what I can do.</p>
      
      <h3>Lines don't show up when I draw / lines show up wrong! Help!</h3>
      <p>On Android/iOS: In the app preferences try turning up "Minimum brush size" and "Minimum brush opacity", these can cause issues on some devices.<br>
      On Windows: Try turning on "Use Windows Ink" in the Wacom Tablet Properties, sometimes this will help.</p>
      
      <h3>It doesn't work! Help!</h3>
      <p>Sorry! I do the best I can, but some bugs always slip through. <a href="contact.html">Contact me</a> with as many details as possible about the problem, and if the app is crashing, use the crash report feature on your device to send me the log of how it happened. 
        I may not be able to respond personally as I get a lot of email, but I will certainly read it and try to fix the problem for the next update.</p>
      
      <p>If a particular project has become corrupted and won't open, send me the file. Chances are I can repair it manually, and it will help me track down whatever bug caused the problem and keep it from happening in the future.</p>
      
      <h3>Who are you?</h3>
      <p>Jacob Kafka, a freelance animator in New York. I've always wanted an animation program like this, and no one else was making one, so I decided to try myself and developed RoughAnimator in my spare time. I've since used it for professional work and so can you!</p>
